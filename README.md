# password_generator

This program is a random password generator that randomly generates a password for the user.

This is a password generator project made to demonstrate my understanding of the random module and of for loops.
Please note that "main.py" does the same thing as "password_generator.py" but with fewer lines and simpler code.
I am including both files for archival and demonstration purposes.
